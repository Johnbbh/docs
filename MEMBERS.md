Hi! I'm a data scientist and one of the Sydney Data for Democracy community leaders. I love to help people use data to drive their goals, whether it's a corporation, for a cause or community. You can ask me anything about D4D Sydney, how we work, how to get involved, how to start something new or share some feedback - we're always tweaking our meetup format to make it the best it can be!
